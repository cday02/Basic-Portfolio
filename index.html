            <p>
                Hey! My name is Cody! I am a long-time tech enthusiast and lifelong gamer. Born and raised in Austin, Texas, I found an interest in computers, especially building machines, at an early age. This lead me to pursue many tech-related interests such as graphic design and coding!            
            </p>
            <p>
                My interests in gaming led me to competing in professional e-sports. Most notably playing for Curse-Gaming, Noble eSports, and Team Liquid in Shootmania, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, and Overwatch respectively.
            </p>
            <p>
                My newest journey to further my knowledge and explore different career opportunites is coding! This is my first full website, and my very own portfolio. Feel free to browse the works I've created here.
            </p>
